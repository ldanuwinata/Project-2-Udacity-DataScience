# Project-2-Udacity-DataScience
In this project, the skills acquired from the course are applied to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
A machine learning pipeline to categorize the disaster events is created, so that the messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
